    "\n",
    "Lazy processing refers to the use of [out-of-core computation algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_memory_algorithm) to process very large data, which are usually too large to fit into the computer's memory at one time. The main idea is to chunk the data in pieces, small enough, that can be processed in memory as illustrated by the following diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"lazy/out-of-core_diagram.svg\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "HyperSpy internally uses the [dask library](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/index.html), which implements the numpy interface to larger-than-memory or distributed environments. The typically workflow for processing data lazily is available on a disk:\n",
    " 1. \"load\" data from disk with a defined chunking\n",
    " 2. schedule operations\n",
    " 3. do the computation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps 1 and 2 are very fast**, because nothing is actually done, other than initialising and scheduling the tasks to be peformed.\n",
    "**Step 3 is slow**, because all the computation is performed at this stage. Most of the time, this is signficantly slower than in memory processing, because the chunks of data needs to be read and written from/to disk when on request of the scheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following diagram shows a task graph, where square and rounds represent arrays and functions, respectively. This graph is an example of how dask is going process the data from the large data set on the harddrive (HDD) into chunks and do computation on these.\n",
