    "# Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) analysis of polycrystalline Nickel\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of EBSD analysis is often to determine the crystal orientation from each EBSD pattern, typically called *indexing*. One approach is dictionary indexing, first described in Chen et al. (2015) ([doi](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927615000756)). Here we'll demonstrate how to do this in [kikuchipy](https://kikuchipy.org). The implementation is based on the one in EMsoft, as described in Jackson et al. (2017) ([doi](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40192-019-00137-4)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary indexing is not as tried and tested as the commonly used Hough indexing. To aid the evaluation of dictionary indexing results, we therefore first obtain several maps to get an overview of the quality of the EBSD patterns and the features in the region of interest before indexing, independent of any bias introdued in indexing. After indexing, we'll also inspect the results visually using dynamical and geometrical EBSD simulations.\n",
