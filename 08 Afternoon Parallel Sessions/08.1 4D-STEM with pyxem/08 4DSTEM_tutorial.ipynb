    "\n",
    "- Pyxem is part of the `Hyperspy` ecosystem specifically designed for analyzing diffraction from pixelated detectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What about 4-D STEM?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Yep! 4-D STEM, 5-D STEM and on.  Pyxem is purposely built to handle any size data that you have. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is avabile in pyXEM?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Orientation Mapping of Crystals\n",
    "- Strain Mapping\n",
    "- Virtual Dark Field Imaging\n",
    "- Differential Phase Contrast (DPC)\n",
    "- Structural Characterization of Amorphous Materials (Angular Correlations/FEM)\n",
    "- And much more!\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Is pyXEM  still in Development?\n",
    "\n",
    "- PyXEM is still in a beta format which means that with every minor relase there will still be API changes.  We try to keep these to a minimum but they will still occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A major relase is upcoming which should stablize pyXEM's API in the near future. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Is pyXEM part of Hyperspy?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Yes! and No... \n",
    "- pyXEM **extends** the capabilities of Hyperspy.  With the new Hyperspy-bundle pyXEM is automatically included which means you won't have to deal with downloading pyXEM seperately!\n",
