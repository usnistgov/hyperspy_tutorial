    "Using machine learning methods, such as independent component analysis (ICA), the composition of embedded nanostructures, such as core-shell nanoparticles, can be accurately measured as demonstrated by D. Roussow et al., Nano Letters, 2015 (see the [full article](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/248102/Roussouw%20et%20al%202015%20Nano%20Letters.pdf?sequence=1)).
