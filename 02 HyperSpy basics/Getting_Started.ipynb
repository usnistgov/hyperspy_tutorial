    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial introduces you to the syntax of hyperspy and shows you how to load, save and visualise data with HyperSpy as well as other basic functionalities, such as using indexing and regions of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although not strictly required, some knowledge of Python can help with getting the most out of HyperSpy. If you are new to Python, the [official tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html) is an excellent way to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial can be enjoyed interactively thanks to the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org) and [IPython](http://ipython.org). If you are not familiar with the Jupyter Notebook, having a look at the `Help` menu above and the [IPython documentation](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/index.html) is highly recommended.\n",

    "## 1. Importing HyperSpy\n",
    "\n",
    "As any other Python library, to use HyperSpy you first need to \"import\" it. The public HyperSpy API can be imported by executing\n",
    "\n",
    "    import hyperspy.api as hs\n",
    "    \n",
    "However, in order to enable interactive plotting, the matplotlib \"backend\" need to be set **first** using the [%matplotlib IPython magic](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/plotting.html) command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, you may come to use the following backend:\n",
    "- `notebook` (Jupyter Notebook only)\n",
    "- `qt`\n",
    "- `widget` (Jupyter Lab and Notebook only).\n",
    "\n",
    "With the `notebook` and `widget` backend, the figure will be embedded in the notebook, while with other backends (`qt` or `tk`), the figure will be displayed as separate windows outside of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** A \"backend\" in this context refers to the code determining the way in which the plotted data will be displayed. In the online version of this document we use the `notebook` backend that displays interactive figures inside the Jupyter Notebook. Other backends, such as `qt` or `tk` can be used. If you get an error message, it is most likely that the selected backend is not available on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detailed explanation on the compatibility of the different matplotlib backends with the HyperSpy GUIs, read the [starting HyperSpy in the notebook](http://hyperspy.org/hyperspy-doc/current/user_guide/getting_started.html#starting-hyperspy-in-the-notebook-or-terminal) section of the documentation."
